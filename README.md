# breast_tissue_refractive_index
Zhentian's code for calculating the refeactive index of breast tissue

# Notes
The code is for calculating refractive index (delta, beta) for breast tissues defined in ICRU Report 46, which is useful for theoretical calculation, dose related simulation etc. 

The material names are given in tissue_composition_ICRU46.m
